# 🐛 Bug Fix: SSE Event Parsing

## Problem
- Event cards showed "System" and "Processing..." for all events
- No actual message content was displayed
- Tasks panel was empty

## Root Cause
**Frontend was parsing SSE events incorrectly!**

The SSE backend sends:
```json
{
  "agent": "ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT",
  "message": "Creating workflow plan..."
}
```

But the frontend was treating the entire parsed JSON as a `WorkflowEvent` object instead of wrapping it in the `data` field.

### Before (Wrong ❌):
```typescript
const event: WorkflowEvent = JSON.parse(e.data);
event.type = 'workflow_start';
// event is now {agent: "...", message: "..."}
// But we expect event.data.agent and event.data.message
```

This caused `event.data` to be `undefined`, so the fallback text "Processing..." was shown.

### After (Fixed ✅):
```typescript
const data = JSON.parse(e.data);
const event: WorkflowEvent = {
    type: 'workflow_start',
    data: data,  // Properly wrap in data field
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
};
// Now event.data.agent and event.data.message work!
```

## What Was Fixed

### All Event Handlers Updated:
- ✅ `workflow_start`
- ✅ `agent_message`
- ✅ `llm_call`
- ✅ `tool_execution`
- ✅ `routing`
- ✅ `task_update`
- ✅ `success`
- ✅ `notification`
- ✅ `log`
- ✅ `workflow_complete`
- ✅ `error`

### Now Working:
1. **Message Content** - Shows actual agent messages
2. **Agent Names** - Displays correct agent (Orchestrator, Operations, Advisor)
3. **Tasks Panel** - Tasks populate and update in real-time
4. **Thinking Indicator** - Shows when agents are processing
5. **Event Filtering** - Clean, conversational UI

## Result
Everything now works as designed! 🎉
- Real-time event streaming ✅
- Proper message content ✅
- Task tracking ✅
- Thinking indicators ✅
- Clean, minimal UI ✅
