## 🎯 Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Duplicate Account Prevention ✅

**Objective**: Verify workflow stops when account already exists

**Steps**:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/workflow
2. Click "Start Workflow" for `john_smith_123` (has existing account)
3. Watch the event stream

**Expected Result**:
```
✅ Eligibility check passes
✅ Documents validated
❌ Account creation FAILS: "Account already exists"
❌ Task marked as "failed"
🚫 Workflow status: "blocked"
```

**Before Fix**: Created 2-3 accounts ❌  
**After Fix**: Stops with blocker ✅

---

### Test 2: Failed Eligibility Check ✅

**Objective**: Verify workflow stops when client is ineligible

**Steps**:
1. Start workflow for client: `test_ineligible` (doesn't exist in CRM)
2. Watch the event stream

**Expected Result**:
```
❌ Eligibility check: "Client test_ineligible not found"
❌ Task marked as "failed"
🚫 Workflow status: "blocked"
⛔ NO account creation attempted
```

**Before Fix**: Created account anyway ❌  
**After Fix**: Stops immediately ✅

---

### Test 3: Invalid Document Validation ✅

**Objective**: Verify workflow stops when documents are invalid

**Steps**:
1. Modify test to have invalid documents (would require code change)
2. Or observe validation behavior in logs

**Expected Result**:
```
❌ Validation: "Missing signature on page 3"
❌ Task marked as "failed"
🚫 Workflow status: "blocked"
⛔ NO account creation attempted
```

**Before Fix**: Ignored validation errors ❌  
**After Fix**: Stops on validation failure ✅

---

### Test 4: Single Task Completion ✅

**Objective**: Verify only ONE task marked at a time

**Steps**:
1. Start any valid workflow
2. Watch task updates in UI (left panel)

**Expected Result**:
```
Task 1: ⏳ In Progress → ✅ Completed
Task 2: ⚪ Pending → ⏳ In Progress → ✅ Completed
Task 3: ⚪ Pending → ⏳ In Progress → ✅ Completed
(Sequential, one at a time)
```

**Before Fix**: Task 1 and Task 3 both complete at once ❌  
**After Fix**: Sequential completion ✅

---

### Test 5: Successful Workflow (Happy Path) ✅

**Objective**: Verify normal workflow still works correctly

**Steps**:
1. Start workflow for new client: `new_client_001`
2. Watch complete flow

**Expected Result**:
```
✅ Eligibility check passes
✅ Forms sent to client
✅ Documents validated
✅ Account created (ONCE!)
✅ Client notified
✅ Workflow completes successfully
```

---

## 📊 What to Look For

### ✅ Good Indicators:
- ❌ Red error icons when things fail
- 🚫 "blocked" status when errors occur
- ⛔ Workflow stops immediately on error
- 📋 Tasks marked as "failed" (not "completed") when errors
- ✅ Only ONE account created per workflow
- ✅ Tasks complete sequentially

### ❌ Bad Indicators (shouldn't see these):
- Multiple accounts created
- "Completed" tasks when errors occurred
- Account creation after eligibility failure
- Multiple tasks completing simultaneously
- Workflow continuing after errors

---

## 🔍 Live Debugging

### Check Backend Logs:
```bash
tail -f /tmp/nexhelm_backend.log | grep -E "❌|✅|🚫|🔧|🤖"
```

### Look for:
```
❌ OPERATIONS_AGENT: Tool 'open_account' failed: Client already has account
❌ OPERATIONS_AGENT: Marked task 'task_1' as failed
🚫 Workflow status: blocked
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

**Fastest way to see the fixes in action**:

1. **Open browser**: http://localhost:3000/workflow

2. **Click "Start Workflow"** (uses default `john_smith_123`)

3. **Watch for**:
   - Real-time event stream (right panel)
   - Task status updates (left panel)
   - Error handling in action

4. **Expected**: You'll likely see "Account already exists" error because `john_smith_123` already has an account from previous runs

5. **This is GOOD!** It proves the fix is working! ✅

## 💡 Tips

- **Refresh browser** before each test to clear state
- **Watch backend logs** for detailed error messages
- **Check left panel** for task status (⚪ pending, ⏳ in-progress, ✅ completed, ❌ failed)
- **Monitor progress bar** - should update smoothly
- **Look for blockers** - workflow should stop when errors occur

**All fixes are deployed and ready to test!** 🎉
